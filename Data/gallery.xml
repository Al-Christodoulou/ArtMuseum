			<info>
				Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890) was a
				Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous
				and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just
				over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including
				around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of
				his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and
				self-portraits, and are characterised by bold, symbolic colours,
				and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive brushwork that
				contributed to the foundations of modern art. Only one of his
				paintings was known by name to have been sold during his lifetime.
				Van Gogh became famous after his suicide at age 37, which followed
				years of poverty and mental illness.

				Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519) was an
				Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter,
				draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.
				While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he
				has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and
				notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany,
				cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to
				have been a genius who epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and
				his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of
				artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.

				Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 - 18 February
				1564), known mononymously as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor,
				painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic
				of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and
				had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities
				and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal
				Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da
				Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and
				reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th
				century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished
				artist of his era.

			<info>
				Oscar-Claude Monet (14 November 1840 - 5 December 1926) was a French painter and
				founder of impressionist painting who is seen as a key precursor to modernism,
				especially in his attempts to paint nature as he perceived it. During his long
				career, he was the most consistent and prolific practitioner of impressionism's
				philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied
				to plein air (outdoor) landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived
				from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant, exhibited in 1874
				(the "exhibition of rejects") initiated by Monet and his associates as an
				alternative to the Salon.
